which is working to create open-content electronic
textbooks that are freely available on the website

The goal is to make textbooks available to the many
who cannot afford them.  For more information on getting

      <para id="id1172237793429">This chapter presents the types of global challenges that Ms. Shahiraâ€™s business could be presented with in the future. As she has done so effectively in her home country, internationally Ms. Shahira has the opportunity to grow her company, and even present her model to other small entrepreneurs to integrate into their businesses. It is important to note however, that the issues discussed only begin to present the common challenges among new entrepreneurs. This is just an introductory start into the journey of extending a small business into new, international markets.</para>
